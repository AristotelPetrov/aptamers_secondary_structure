- data.csv - dataset of aptamers sequences and secondary structures: results of searching in NAKB by queries "aptamer" and "riboswitch" on DNA and RNA were obtained, secondary structures were obtained by 3DNA DSSR (used through rnapdbee web-sever with default settings, , sequence duplicates were removed

- eda.ipynb - EDA on some properties of the aptamers sequences: number of DNA and RNA sequences, percentage of paired and unpaired nucleotides, percentage of pseudoknotted pairs

- benchmark_RNAfold_and_IPknot.ipynb - metrics of IPknot and RNAfold performance on aptamers dataset

- benchmark_eternafold.ipynb - metrics of EternaFold performance on aptamers dataset

- benchmark_mxfold2.ipynb - metrics of MXfold2 performance on aptamers dataset

- supplement - directory with some additional code that can be useful for replication of this work
